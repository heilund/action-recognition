# Action-Recognition
Master thesis - using deep learning for action recognition

## Tools
Using the pre-trained model from st-gcn: https://github.com/yysijie/st-gcn (Kinetics)
> Necessary software installations etc., are described in that project (should probably add it here later as well)

### NOTE: Most/all commands that involves st-gcn requires the user to be in the 'st-gcn' folder

## TODO
1. Refactor code
2. Predict on multiple videos at once
3. Document (in a local README-file) in both **/st-gcn** and **/openpose** important files (scripts, generated files, etc.)
4. Understand both gendata, and prediction (the relationship between the different folders and files)
5. Research the possibility of (frame) padding videos < 300 frames
6. Research the possibility of stop frame translation > 300 frames
